# Project_public_and_social_services
 Progetto public &amp; social services - Universit√† degli studi Milano Bicocca
 
 This project aims to develop a prototype for the healthcare sector, focusing on optimizing and automating access to information and the available clinics located in Lombardy, Italy. It aims to optimize and automate access to health information, considering challenges related to data privacy and inconsistencies within the healthcare system. The development of the project is based on the LangChain framework, powered by the GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Tailored explanations and support to the user is given by a list of tools that the agent decides to implement based on some task-specific settings provided. Furthermore, an integration with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology is envisioned to extract outpatient services directly from electronic prescriptions, with the aim of locating suitable clinics. Several limitations have been recognized regarding the domain of interest, the computational costs of the model related to both prompt and evaluation, output control, and the integration of certain tools, such as OCR technology, which in itself has also criticality in dealing with certain types of files and documents.
Although this project tackles complexities to deliver automated and accessible support for citizens, it has laid the groundwork for further advancements and enhancements in digital
healthcare, presenting opportunities for progress in the field.
